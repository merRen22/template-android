# Template Android

This project is a template for an android project that used the following libraries ðŸ‘‡

- Navigation (Fragment transitions)
- View Binding (Bind views)
- ViewModel (Store and manage UI-related data)
- LveData (Observable data)
- Kotlin Coroutine (Light-weight threads)
- Dagger2 (Dependency Injection)
- Hilt (Dependency Injection for Android)
- Retrofit (HTTP client)
- Multi Module App
- Mockito
- Compose
- Room
- KotlinDsl

It is also configured to work with compose and dynamic modules

## Refactoring

In order to change the versions and dependecies access the buildSrc module. It contains everything related to versions and packages names

## Modules

The project contains the following base modules:

- App ( Initial module with the main activity of the project. Because single activity was used on the project )
- Base ( Contains the navigation between the UI modules and generic classes )
- Data ( Used for making request to the API and the the local BD)
- Model ( Declares all the entities used in the project )
- âš  For the UI you are supposed to build new modules that can be dynamic or a feature module

## Architecture

This app was build using MVVM and following the guidelines explain [here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide). This app also makes use of the pattern single activity.

All the transitions for the app where made using [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation)

## Run the app locally
As the app makes usd of dynamic modules in order to test it locally you need to generate a universal version containing all the modules. The following commands allow to generate the apk ðŸ‘‡

```sh
//Windows
gradlew :app:packageDebugUniversalApk
//Mac/linux
./gradlew :app:packageDebugUniversalApk
```

## ðŸš¨ Dependency Issues

List of issue related to version of dependecies and limitations

- Compose navigation dont not allow to use dynamic modules natively- Google issue [here](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/183677219)
